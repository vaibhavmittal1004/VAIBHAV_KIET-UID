<h2>चरन्मार्गान्विजानाति | :  ("A wandrer eventually knows its path")</h2>
<!--चरन्मार्गान्विजानाति |= a wanderer eventually knows its path  -->

<!-- Introduction paragraph about the  philosophy of travel -->
<p>
Travel is not just about moving from one place to another — <s>it’s about awakening</s> your spirit to the endless wonders of existence.  When you step outside your routine, you discover that the world is not small but an infinite canvas painted with <s> cultures, landscapes</s>, and people waiting to share their stories. <strong>Every sunrise in a distant land whispers the promise of new beginnings, while every sunset you witness away from home reminds you that life’s most beautiful moments cannot be contained within four walls.</strong> Don’t let your days slip away in monotony—let them be filled with <u>breathtaking mountains, bustling streets, and the quiet magic of unfamiliar skies.</u>
<br><br>

The  <s> truth </s> is, we were not born just to work, sleep, and repeat. The world is too vast and too beautiful to be left unexplored. <strong>Pack your bags, leave behind fear, and embrace the unknown. </strong>You’ll return with not just photos, but lessons, friendships, and memories that last a lifetime. <i><u>Don’t wait for the “perfect moment,” because it doesn’t exist—create it instead.</u></i> And if doubt whispers <s>“maybe later”</s>, remember this: later often turns into never, and “never” is nothing but a lost chance ~struck out of your life forever~. <strong>Your journey begins the moment you decide to take the first step.</strong></p>
